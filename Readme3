# AMNESIS / Prime Move Theory

**A complete alternative to cosmic inflation with testable predictions**

## 🔬 Core Theory
Reality operates via a 5-stage recursive loop (the "cheat code"):
1. **Split** → Differentiation from unity
2. **Tension** → Accumulated pressure toward reunion  
3. **Failed Merge** → Incomplete resolution
4. **Scar** → Persistent structural change
5. **Decay** → Gradual relaxation at ŌÜŐā ≈ 0.618 rate

**Finite Prime Move**: Exact closure (Pythagorean theorem, clean equations)  
**Infinite Prime Move**: Asymptotic patterns (φ ≈ 1.618, entanglement)

## 🌌 Key Predictions (Differing from Standard Inflation)

| Prediction | AMNESIS | Standard Inflation | Test Timeline |
|------------|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **CMB Non-Gaussianity (f_NL)** | ≈ 43.1 | ≈ 1 | CMB-S4 (~2035) |
| **Primordial Gravitational Waves (r)** | ≈ 0 | > 0.001 | CMB-S4 (~2035) |
| **Biological Decay Constant** | ŌÜŐā ≈ 0.618 | No prediction | Testable now |
| **Fine-Structure Constant Variation** | Lorentzian width ~10⁻⁸ | No variation | Next-gen atomic clocks |

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation
- **Negative-dimensional boundaries**: D₋₁ with volume V = -2π/r
- **Dual-lattice ontology**: Lattice 1 (Score) ↔ Lattice 2 (Performance)
- **Scar-time mechanics**: Δt ∝ 1/ρₛ (time as scar density)
- **φ as fixed point**: x = 1 + 1/x → φ ≈ 1.618

## 🚀 Immediate Testability
1. **CMB-S4** (launch ~2030) will measure f_NL and r
2. **Biological apoptosis** should show ŌÜŐā-rate decay
3. **Neural scar density** should correlate with subjective time acceleration
4. **Atomic clocks** may detect α variation near masses
